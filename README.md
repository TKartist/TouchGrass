# TouchGrass

This is some stuff I am making because I am bored, and need to make new friends in this damned unfriendly city.
Making friends in a new city is hard. Because, let's face it; Our generation don't know how to become friends with random people in a bar
or really anywhere. Tnx fucking Marky Zucky.

We need to come up with a safe platform, which means we need to create a platform where it doesn't become an "a la carte" menu for serial
killers, or carnibals. Best approach would probably be a recommender system, so we don't have to worry about random potential "Tinder Swindler"
situation. This is where I am kinda thinking of using smart-contracts. Generate a smart contract everytime a reliable source creates
a referal code, and you can only join the platform through that smart contract. Preferably, we can give "Elder/administrator" rights to
reputable public entities like universities. (We don't collect the personal data, but we only request the info through the public institution,
leave out the fear of again, marky zucky 2.0. Preferably, the smart contracts will work like a rule book for crawling the user info,
kinda like the web crawler situation; P.S. I still have to figure this out, it's 12AM, and the idea kinda came randomly so, let's see where it goes)

This approach will kinda slow down the progress of user growth, and have few loopholes. What's the point of a social platform to make friends,
if there aren't people to be friends with on the platform right (Fucking DAHHHHH). So we give a similar privilage to normal users.
Then again, WTF, a serial killer can recommend a serial killer friend, and do a brunch date with a innocent newcomer to the city.
Hence, what I was thinking of doing is a scoring/ranking system to earn the privilage. Kinda like UBER, you get stars from people you met
online, and you only get the right to create smart contracts for new people IF you have enough points; which will be determined by
the score of smart contract generator (higher initial score if you are referred by an already established user of the platform),
number of friends you made, the score you got from those strangers, the amount of information you have provided, and the score of
the person you have referred. I think this should be NEAT. There is only so much we can do for safety, to be fair I think this is
borderline, dystopian societal structure but ehhh whatevs right?!

## About the Project

Should start from a website I think
- Touching Grass (euphemism for CS students who have 0 social skills, honestly, my first idea to get friends is making a platform, I am kinda the audience this shit is being built for)
- Webapp
- Smart Contracts
- Ranking algorithms
- Data privacy
- Problem is I don't know jack shit about web3 so I will probably have to dig online a bit, BUT, hey, can't be that hard right?
- Also probably would have to come up with LOGOS and stuff and steal my friend's commercial DB so fingers crossed right?
- I think I will just build the ranking algo, smart contract, and other tricky parts, and get some people to do the front-end part.
